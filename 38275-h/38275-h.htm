    INTRODUCTION
</p>
<p>
The two pamphlets reproduced here belong to the fierce heightening in
the pamphlet campaign against Robert Walpole that took place at the end
of 1740. They represent only two efforts within a brief but furious
encounter that gave rise to the publication of no fewer than nine
separate poems. On Thursday, 23 October 1740, Thomas Cooper, "one of the
most prolific printers and publishers of the pamphlet literature of the
eighteenth century,"<a name="ft01"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn01">&nbsp;1&nbsp;</a> published a savage denunciation of Walpole
called <i>Are these things so?</i><a name="ft02"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn02">&nbsp;2&nbsp;</a> This pamphlet, which took the fictional
form of an open letter from Alexander Pope, "An Englishman in his
Grotto," to Robert Walpole, "A Great Man at Court," set off a round of
verse writing among the party hacks of the day that vividly illustrates
the close relationship between literature and politics in the first half
of the eighteenth century. Within the space of two months eight further
pamphlets directly related to this pamphlet and to Walpole's position as
First Minister were published. Such a spate of literary activity is only
remarkable, however, when compared with other ages. While it is
inconceivable that the publication of any poem in our own day, even by a
major writer, should arouse such a response, it is reasonably typical of
the first half of the eighteenth century that the publication of an
occasional poem by a minor, indeed anonymous, writer should do so.
</p>
<p>
On Saturday, 8 November, two weeks after the opening blast, Cooper
delivered a second volley, an equally fierce (although largely
repetitive) denunciation of Walpole entitled <i>Yes, they are:</i>.<a name="ft03"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn03">&nbsp;3&nbsp;</a> A week
later still, on Saturday, 15 November, the first pro-Government riposte,
called <i>What of That!</i>, was published,<a name="ft04"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn04">&nbsp;4&nbsp;</a> followed three days later, on
18 November, by a second reply, <i>The Weather-Menders: A proper Answer to
Are these things so?</i><a name="ft05"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn05">&nbsp;5&nbsp;</a> The second edition of <i>What of That!</i> was
published on the following Saturday, 22 November,<a name="ft06"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn06">&nbsp;6&nbsp;</a> and a third
pro-Walpole poem entitled <i>They are Not</i>, was also published at about
this time.<a name="ft07"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn07">&nbsp;7&nbsp;</a> At the end of November, or early in December, a reply to
all three of these defences of Walpole appeared carrying the title,
<i>Have at you All</i>.<a name="ft08"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn08">&nbsp;8&nbsp;</a> On Tuesday, 2 December, the pro-Walpole forces
returned to the attack again with a poem entitled <i>What Things?</i><a name="ft09"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn09">&nbsp;9&nbsp;</a> This
was followed on Saturday, 6 December, by the second edition, "corrected,
with the addition of twenty lines omitted in the former impressions" of
<i>Are these things so?</i>,<a name="ft10"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn10">&nbsp;10&nbsp;</a> and on Thursday, 18 December, by yet another
anti-Walpole poem, <i>The Great Man's Answer</i><a name="ft11"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn11">&nbsp;11&nbsp;</a> purporting to be "by the
author of <i>Are these things so?</i>." But the pro-Walpole forces were still
not silenced and two days later on Saturday, 20 December, published <i>A
Supplement to Are these things so?</i>,<a name="ft12"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn12">&nbsp;12&nbsp;</a> an attack on the Patriot
opponents of the Ministry. A month later still, on Friday, 23 January
1741,<a name="ft13"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn13">&nbsp;13&nbsp;</a> the third edition of <i>They are Not</i> was published. Hereafter
this particular controversy seemed to burn itself out, although an
anonymous poem entitled <i>The Art of Poetry</i>, published on 17 March 1741,
contains a long attack on <i>Are these things so?</i>.
</p>
<p>
This confused battle is most easily summarized by saying that four
separate pamphlets (not counting second and third editions) were
published which attacked Walpole, and five which defended him. The poems
attacking Walpole are far more poetically versatile than those defending
him and it is the two most interesting of these attacks that are
reproduced here. Taken together, this series of nine pamphlets forms a
separate battle within that much larger and continuing war waged by Lord
Bolingbroke and the various supporters of the Patriot Opposition against
Sir Robert Walpole and the defenders of his Whig Ministry. From the
first publication of <i>The Craftsman</i> on 5 December 1726 to the final
resignation of the "Great Man" on 11 February 1742 it is probably true
to say that no English politician has ever been so continuously and so
virulently attacked by so eminent an assemblage of literary persons. Gay,
Swift, Pope, Arbuthnot, Chesterfield, Lyttleton, Thomson, Fielding, and
Johnson each entered the fray at various stages. The fact that Walpole
rode out these attacks for so long is more of a comment on the
disorganized nature of the opposition politically and on the astute
manoeuvring of Walpole himself, than on the ineffectiveness of the
attacks.
</p>
<p>
During the protracted span of this campaign there were only two periods
during which the supporters of the Patriot cause had any real chance of
toppling Walpole. The first came in 1733 when sustained opposition
forced Walpole to drop his proposed Excise Scheme, while the second
occurred five years later in 1738 and sprang from a new deterioration in
Anglo-Spanish relations. Although Walpole did not finally resign until
11 February 1742 his fall from power was a direct result of this
deterioration. His position in the House of Commons, and in the country
at large, was never as assured in the last four years of his "reign" as
it had been in the first seventeen.
</p>
<p>
The pamphlets reproduced here deal with Walpole's declining reputation
and especially with his handling of Spanish policy. The causes of the
English differences with Spain go back to 1713 and the Treaty of Utrecht
in which the South Sea Company had been granted, amongst other
privileges, the right to send one trading vessel a year to the Spanish
possessions.<a name="ft14"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn14">&nbsp;14&nbsp;</a> This right had been grossly abused by English merchants
eager to make large profits and a great number of English trading ships
annually smuggled goods to Spanish America. The Spanish governors were
only too pleased to accept such contraband trade for by it they avoided
payment of duties to the King of Spain. In order to defend themselves
against this illegal traffic the Spanish authorities established a fleet
of <i>guarda-costas</i> to intercept, search, and, if necessary, punish the
English ships. The <i>guarda-costas</i> did this with great effect and, on
occasion, with considerable cruelty. The most notorious example
concerned the capture, near Jamaica in 1731, of Captain Robert Jenkins'
ship, the <i>Rebecca</i>, and the ensuing removal of one of Jenkins' ears. It
was with Jenkins' presentation of this ear, which "wrapt up in cotton,
he always carried about him,"<a name="ft15"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn15">&nbsp;15&nbsp;</a> before the House of Commons seven years
later in March 1738 that Anglo-Spanish differences came to a head.
</p>
<p>
The Patriots demanded war and revenge: Walpole, however, was committed
to a policy of peace. Accordingly, he spent the rest of the year trying
to patch things up and the ill-fated Convention of Pardo concluded on 14
January 1739 was the result. The Convention involved compromise on both
sides. England claimed that Spain owed her £343,277 by way of reparation
for damages done to English vessels, and Spain claimed that England owed
her £180,000 by way of arrears on duties due to the King of Spain. This
left a balance of £163,277 and England agreed to accept £95,000 as a
total discharge in return for payment within four months.<a name="ft16"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn16">&nbsp;16&nbsp;</a>
</p>
<p>
On 1 February Walpole laid this Convention before Parliament, and,
despite vociferous opposition, it was eventually ratified on 9 March by
a vote of 244 to 214. As a result of this ratification a considerable
section of the opposition, under the leadership of Sir William Wyndham,
immediately seceded from Parliament. Feelings had never been higher. On
15 May, one day after the payment had fallen due, Benjamin Keene, the
British Minister in Madrid, was officially informed that the £95,000
would only be paid if Admiral Haddock removed his fleet from the
Mediterranean. England had no intention of recalling Haddock, for both
Gibraltar and Minorca would then remain defenceless, and Spain clearly
had no real intention of paying the money. From this point on war became
inevitable and on 19 October 1739 the declaration was made "and was
received by all ranks and distinctions of men with a degree of
enthusiasm and joy, which announced the general frenzy of the
nation."<a name="ft17"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn17">&nbsp;17&nbsp;</a> It was on hearing the church bells pealing at the news that
Walpole made his famous remark: "They now ring the bells, but they will
soon wring their hands.<a name="ft18"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn18">&nbsp;18&nbsp;</a>
</p>
<p>
One month later, on 22 November, Admiral Vernon captured Porto Bello,
the port in which the <i>guarda-costas</i> had been fitted out. The news
of this victory did not arrive in England until nearly four months later
on 13 March 1740, but it brought with it great public excitement and
jubilation. Thus by the end of 1740 the revenge on the Spanish had
begun. Those who had demanded war seemed justified and Walpole had been
discredited. This is the political background against which these
pamphlets are set.
</p>
<p class="margtop2">
Both pamphlets have been attributed to James Miller, but the evidence
for such attribution is cumulative rather than definitive.<a name="ft19"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn19">&nbsp;19&nbsp;</a> <i>Are
these things so?</i> has been far more frequently attributed to Miller
than <i>The Great Man's Answer</i>. The earliest attribution is found in
D. E. Baker's <i>Biographia Dramatica</i> which, although it was not
published till 1812, was originally compiled by Baker sometime before
1764.<a name="ft20"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn20">&nbsp;20&nbsp;</a> Robert Watt also lists <i>Are these things so?</i> as Miller's
work in his <i>Bibliotheca Britannica</i>, Edinburgh, 1824.<a name="ft21"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn21">&nbsp;21&nbsp;</a> The entries
under Miller in the <i>CBEL</i> and <i>DNB</i> both accept these attributions as
does the <i>British Museum Catalogue</i>. The evidence for attributing <i>The
Great Man's Answer</i> to Miller is far more slender and rests largely on
the publisher's claim on the title page, which may well have been made
for the sake of promotion, that it is "By the Author of <i>Are these
things so?</i>".
</p>
<p>
James Miller, 1706-1744, is better known as a comic dramatist than as a
poet. He was the son of a clergyman from Upcerne in Dorset, and was
educated at Wadham College, Oxford, where he wrote a comedy, <i>The
Humours of Oxford</i>, which was successfully performed at Drury Lane in
January 1730. On leaving Oxford he had been expected by his relations to
go into business, but "not being able to endure the servile drudgery it
demanded," he took holy orders and continued to write plays "to increase
his finances."<a name="ft22"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn22">&nbsp;22&nbsp;</a> From 1730 until his death in 1744 he wrote ten plays,
several of which were performed with considerable success.<a name="ft23"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn23">&nbsp;23&nbsp;</a>
</p>
<p>
But it is as a poet that we are primarily interested in Miller. He was
the author of several occasional poems of which his <i>Harlequin Horace,
or the Art of Modern Poetry</i>, 1731, was the best known. This poem, yet
another imitation of Horace's <i>Ars Poetica</i> is an attack on John Rich,
the manager of Lincoln's Inn Fields and Covent-Garden. The poem is
ironically full of perverse modern advice on how to write poetry. Miller
adopts the persona of a modern Grub Street poet who scorns the classical
values. Consequently Pope, who insists on standards of excellence, is
seen by the persona as the great enemy of modern poets. At the same time
it is quite clear that for Miller himself Pope is the greatest of poets.
The poem includes an attack on Walpole (ll. 209-216), and perhaps it was
this that led the agents of the Ministry to make him the large offer
referred to in the biography of Miller found in Cibber's <i>Lives</i>. But,
as the anonymous writer of this life goes on to point out, Miller "had
virtue sufficient to withstand the temptation, though his circumstances
at that time were far from being easy."<a name="ft24"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn24">&nbsp;24&nbsp;</a>
</p>
<p>
A second verse satire in the manner of Horace, <i>Seasonable Reproof</i>,
1735, has also been attributed to Miller. The poem is a general satire
on Britain's "State of Reprobation," and only makes a passing glance at
Walpole. London has been so forsaken by people all rushing to the
Italian opera that
</p>
<p class="margleft">
    By <i>Excisemen</i>, it might now be taken,<br>
    And great Sir <i>Bob</i> ride through, and save his Bacon (ll. 6-7).<br>
</p>
<p class="noindent">
But more significant in our context is that, as Maynard Mack has shown,
the author creates a speaker "who by his careful echoings of the
<i>Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot</i> seems to labor to be mistaken for Pope."<a name="ft25"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn25">&nbsp;25&nbsp;</a>
</p>
<p>
If Miller was the author of both <i>Seasonable Reproof</i> and <i>Are these
things so?</i> his fascination with the persona of the poet in his grotto
emerges as no sudden whim of wit, but as a continuing concern with the
symbolic significance of Pope's actual life. Furthermore, the poet who
attacked Walpole so violently in October 1740 emerges as no upstart
Patriot cashing in on Walpole's current unpopularity, but as a
consistent and courageous opponent of Walpole since at least 1731.
</p>

<p class="margtop2">
In <i>Are these things so?</i> Pope is imagined to be speaking throughout,
although he in turn imagines what Walpole might say at various points.
The poem is full of allusions and references intended to support the
pretense that Pope is speaking. In line eight the speaker says his
luxury is "lolling in my peaceful Grot"; in lines fifteen and sixteen
he echoes Pope's famous claim in <i>To Fortescue</i> that he is "TO VIRTUE
ONLY and HER FRIENDS, A FRIEND,"<a name="ft26"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn26">&nbsp;26&nbsp;</a> when he says:
</p>
<p class="margleft">
    Close shut my Cottage-Gate, where none pretends<br>
    To lift the Latch but Virtue and her Friends;<br>
</p>
<p class="noindent">
and in lines seventeen and eighteen he shows that he knew Walpole had
once visited Pope at Twickenham.<a name="ft27"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn27">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a>
</p>
<p>
These allusions to Pope's actual life have been carefully chosen by the
author in order to give dramatic credibility to his chosen spokesman
rather than to persuade the reader that Pope was the real author. The
impersonation of Pope is meant to be transparent: the poet is
demonstrating his versatility at imitating Pope and has considerable fun
in doing so. The only evidence that could be brought in to support an
interpretation that stressed the author's serious intent to make Pope
seem the real author concerns a Dublin reprint of the poem that actually
carried Pope's name as author on the title page. But it is extremely
unlikely that the true author had anything to do with this since the
Dublin publisher did not even bother to incorporate the corrections and
additions that the poet had made to the second edition.
</p>
<p>
To point out that the device of creating a spokesman is meant to be seen
through is not the same thing, however, as saying that the author could
afford to admit his authorship. There were good reasons why the author
of a poem that was primarily an attack on the First Minister, and who
was himself probably without any great influence or reputation, should
need to hide the fact of his authorship. For such a person the choice of
Pope as spokesman could hardly have been more appropriate.<a name="ft28"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn28">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a>
</p>
<p>
In May and July 1738 Pope had published his devastating attacks on the
state of the country known as <i>The Epilogue to the Satires</i>. On 31
January 1739 Paul Whitehead published his attack on the artificialities
and disguises of Walpole's Ministry and the Court favourites in a poem
(which Boswell refers to as "brilliant and pointed"<a name="ft29"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn29">&nbsp;29&nbsp;</a>) called
<i>Manners: A Satire</i>. At this point the government decided that it was
time they attempted to stop, or at least stem, these attacks. They were
not keen to confront Pope himself, but Whitehead presented a less
formidable opponent.<a name="ft30"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn30">&nbsp;30&nbsp;</a> Consequently, in February 1739, he and his
publisher Robert Dodsley were summoned before the bar of the House of
Lords to account for the attacks on named individuals in <i>Manners</i>.
On Monday, 12 February, the poem "was voted scandalous, etc. by the Lords,
and the author and publisher ordered into custody, where Mr. Dodsley,
the publisher, was a week; but Mr. Paul Whitehead, the author,
absconds."<a name="ft31"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn31">&nbsp;31&nbsp;</a> Whitehead anticipated this summons when he wrote in the
poem:
</p>
<p class="margleft">
    <i>Pope</i> writes unhurt&mdash;but know, 'tis different quite<br>
    To beard the lion, and to crush the mite.<br>
    Safe may he dash the Statesman in each line,<br>
    Those dread his satire, who dare punish mine (p. 15).<br>
</p>
<p>
Pope was then the ideal spokesman for our author's purposes: the mite
must dress up as the lion. It was admittedly almost two years since
Whitehead's original summons, but the incident was well enough
remembered to spur a gossip columnist writing in <i>The Daily Gazetteer</i>
on 11 November 1740 to suggest that Whitehead was the author of <i>Are
these things so?</i> Whitehead, too, evidently felt the danger of the
situation for he deemed it necessary to publish a denial four days
later.<a name="ft32"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn32">&nbsp;32&nbsp;</a>
</p>
<p>
In choosing Pope for his spokesman the author of <i>Are these things so?</i>
showed a full awareness of the political realities. He also showed a
detailed familiarity with Pope's life and work. There is nothing,
however, to indicate that such knowledge was reciprocal, or even to
indicate that Pope knew of the poem's existence. The only evidence that
Pope knew anything about Miller's work, if indeed Miller was the author,
comes in a letter Pope wrote to Caryll on 6 February 1731 in which he
praises <i>Harlequin Horace</i> although he does not seem to know the
author's name.<a name="ft33"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn33">&nbsp;33&nbsp;</a>
</p>
<p>
<i>Are these things so?</i> opens with Pope challenging Walpole to explain
why Britain has fallen as low as she has and why France and Spain have
been allowed "to limit out her sea." Walpole is then imagined defending
his measures, especially the Excise Scheme, the Convention of Pardo,
Placement and the Secret Service. In the second half of the poem the
satirist repeats the charges and invites Walpole to turn his eyes inward
and imagine that he dies guilty. Pope then begs Walpole to resign and,
failing that, begs the King to intervene. The poem closes in a positive
way by turning from Walpole and listing other persons (all members of
the Opposition) that George II might appoint to a new Ministry.
</p>
<p>
In the first edition (23 October) these persons were given fictitious
names. The second edition (6 December) not only substituted their real
names but also added twenty lines at the end which included Cobham and
Argyle in the list of worthies. It is this edition,which carries an
Advertisement explaining these changes, that we have reproduced here.
</p>
<p>
Finally it seems helpful to append a few notes to help identify some of
the allusions. In line 63 (p. 4) the "ONE more noble than the rest" is
presumably Henry St. John, Viscount Bolingbroke who was stripped of his
title by Act of Attainder in 1725. In line 73 (p. 5) the "brave and
honest <i>Adm'ral</i>" is Vernon who captured Porto Bello on 22 November
1739. The "<i>sturdy Beggars</i>" mentioned in line 100 (p. 6), was the
appelation used by Walpole in referring to the mob outside the door of
Parliament on 14 March 1733, and was taken up by the Opposition as
pertaining to all the merchants and individuals opposed to the
Excise.<a name="ft34"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn34">&nbsp;34&nbsp;</a> In line 129 (p. 8) the "C&mdash;n&mdash;&mdash;n" is the Convention of Pardo
described earlier in this introduction. In line 139 (p. 8) the "BROTHER"
referred to is Horatio Walpole who was a frequent ambassador abroad for
Robert Walpole's government. In line 218 (p. 12) "HE whose <i>Fame</i> to
both the Poles is known" is George II.
</p>
<p>
The persons named at the end of the poem as possible replacements for
Walpole are all persons who were at one time members of the Whig party
but who had joined the opposition because of their dislike for Walpole.
John Carteret, Earl Granville (ll. 231-236, p. 13, and referred to as
Camillus in the first edition), had a long struggle with Walpole for
control of the Whig party and joined the Opposition Whigs after he
returned from the lord lieutenancy of Ireland in 1730. It was Carteret
who was to move the unsuccessful resolution on 13 February 1741,
requesting the King to remove Walpole from his "presence and counsels
for ever." William Pulteney, Earl of Bath (ll. 237-242, p. 13, and
referred to as Demosthenes in the first edition) was also an early ally
of Walpole's who later broke with him to form the Patriot party. He
became one of the editors of <i>The Craftsman</i>. Philip Stanhope, Earl of
Chesterfield (ll. 243-245, p. 13, and referred to as Atticus in the
first edition) was also a lifelong Whig who joined Carteret in leading
the opposition to Walpole in the Lords. Hugh Hume, Lord Polwarth and
Earl of Marchmont (ll. 246-257, p. 14, and referred to as "that fam'd
<i>Caledonian Youth</i>" in the first edition), had been a persistent and
relentless opponent of Walpole in the Commons, but on the death of his
father in February 1740 had acceded to the Earldom of Marchmont and been
unable to get elected as a representative peer. Although twenty years
younger than Pope (he was only 32 in 1740) he became a close friend and
was appointed an executor of his will. Pope refers to his friendship in
his <i>Verses on a Grotto</i>: "And the bright Flame was shot thro'
MARCHMONT'S Soul."<a name="ft35"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn35">&nbsp;35&nbsp;</a> Sir Richard Temple, Viscount Cobham (ll. 258-261,
p. 14), was also a staunch Whig who broke with Walpole and joined the
Patriots. He, too, was an intimate friend of Pope's who addressed the
first moral essay to him and praised his famous gardens at Stowe in the
fourth. John Campbell, Duke of Argyle (ll. 262-265, pp. 14-15) was a
distinguished soldier who joined the Opposition during the discussion of
Spanish affairs. Both Pope and Thomson had celebrated his eloquence, and
ll. 262-263 here are a direct recollection of lines 86-87 in Pope's
<i>Epilogue to the Satires: Dialogue II</i>:
</p>
<p class="margleft">
    ARGYLE, the State's whole Thunder born to wield,<br>
    And shake alike the Senate and the Field.<br>
</p>
<p class="noindent">
With the exception of Carteret each of the persons named at the end of
the poem was either an acquaintance or a close friend of Pope's. We have
here one last example of the remarkable degree to which the author of
this pamphlet had assimilated the true facts of Pope's life into his
fictional re-creation.
</p>
<p class="margtop2">
According to the title page, <i>The Great Man's Answer</i> is by the
same author as <i>Are these things so?</i>. Once again, the setting is Pope's
grotto, but this time the poet engages Walpole in a direct dialogue. The
poem begins with the poet being disturbed in his retreat by someone
"thundering at the gate." It is Walpole who has come to answer the
questions asked in <i>Are these things so?</i>. He maintains that Britain has
not fallen as low as Pope claims and that the Honour of the Fleet is
still intact. He defends his handling of Parliament, his fiscal
policies, his appointment of Placemen and Pensioners, his attitude to
Commerce, and the self-aggrandisement involved in many of his contracts.
These defences, which only bring out a severer irony in Pope, lead up to
Walpole's version of his own epitaph in contrast to that given him in
<i>Are these things so?</i>. Where Pope had stressed his role as the
grave-digger of British Liberty, Walpole sees himself as the healer of
factions. Finally he falls back on his ultimate weapon of bribery. But
his offers of money, pension, place, title, and honour are turned down
by the poet with increasing scorn, and the poem ends with appropriate
focus on Pope's incorruptibility.
</p>
<p>
The following notes are offered to help with the topical allusions.<a name="ft36"></a><a class="fn" href="#fn36">&nbsp;36&nbsp;</a>
The poem opens with Pope directing his servant, John Serle (1. 7, p. 1),
to see who is thundering at his gate. This is a playful allusion to the
famous opening of <i>An Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot</i> where Serle had been
urged to an exactly opposite course of action. The "<i>Gazetteer</i> Abuse"
scornfully mentioned by Pope (1. 37, p. 3) is a reference to <i>The Daily
Gazetteer</i>, a pro-Government newspaper which ran from 30 June 1735-20
June 1745. The incomplete words, "Se&mdash;s" (1. 66, p. 4) and "P&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;ts!"
(1. 79, p. 5) refer to Senates and Parliaments respectively. Walpole's
claim (1. 89, p. 5) that "<i>Gin</i> would then be drank without control"
refers to the government's Gin Act of 1736, which placed an excise of
five shillings a gallon on gin. His later claim that there would be "No
<i>License</i> on the <i>Press</i>, or on the <i>Stage</i>" (1. 98, p. 6) refers to the
Stage Licensing Act of 1737, which placed the theatre under the control
of the Lord Chamberlain.
</p>
<p>
For Pope's ironic application of the epithet "sturdy" (1. 164, p. 9) to
the London Merchants see the notes to <i>Are these things so?</i>. Pope's
mention of "<i>Angria</i>" (1. 204, p. 11) is a comparison of Walpole to a
Mahrattan pirate chief of the early part of the century. Walpole's
introduction to his own epitaph, "They <i>best</i> can speak it, who will
<i>feel</i> it most" (1. 223, p. 12) is an allusion to Pope's <i>Eloisa to
Abelard</i> (1. 366): "He best can paint 'em who shall feel 'em most."

 At the same time the South Sea Company agreed to pay a duty of 25%
on all profits to the King of Spain. It was the question of the payment
of this duty for illegal trips that became the basis of Spain's later
claim for reparation. These details are taken from William Coxe,

 Most of the details in this brief biography, including these
quotations, are taken from "The Life of the Revd. Mr. James Millar,"
<i>The Lives of the Poets of Great-Britain and Ireland</i>, By Mr.
Theophilus Cibber, and other hands (London, 1753), V, 332-334.

 One of these, <i>The Man of Taste</i>, 1735, has sometimes been
mistakenly confused with a pamphlet written three years earlier, <i>Mr.
Taste, The Poetical Fop</i>, which viciously attacked Pope. See James T.
Hillhouse, "The Man of Taste," <i>MLN</i>, XLIII (1928), 174-176. There is no
evidence that Miller ever attacked Pope and, indeed, his political and
literary sympathies put him strongly on Pope's side.

 A. Pope, <i>The First Satire of the Second Book of Horace Imitated</i>
(London, 1733), l. 121. It is perhaps interesting to note that according
to J. V. Guerinot, <i>Pamphlet Attacks on Alexander Pope 1711-1744</i>
(London, 1969), p. xlviii, "No other line more infuriated the dunces,
it was for them Pope's ultimate hypocrisy."
</p>
<p class="fn"><span><a class="fn" href="#ft27">&nbsp;27&nbsp;</a></span><a name="fn27"></a>
 Walpole visited Pope sometime in the summer of 1725. See Pope's
letter to Fortescue, 23 September 1725. <i>The Correspondence of Alexander
Pope</i>, ed. G. Sherburn (Oxford, 1956), II, 323.
</p>
<p class="fn"><span><a class="fn" href="#ft28">&nbsp;28&nbsp;</a></span><a name="fn28"></a>
 For a full account of the ways in which Pope's actual retired life
in his Twickenham villa, garden, and grotto became, in the 1730's,
emblematic of the ideal of cultivated virtue, see Maynard Mack, <i>The
Garden and the City</i>, especially Chapter VI. According to Mack, Pope
becomes "spiritual patron of the poetical opposition to Walpole"
(p. 190).

 This assumption is based on Johnson's comment in his life of Pope
that "the whole process was probably intended rather to intimidate Pope
than to punish Whitehead." S. Johnson, <i>Lives of the English Poets</i>, ed.

 It should be noted that the pamphlet is full of typographical
errors. Lines 104-106, p. 6, should be prefixed by "G.M.," since
Walpole must be the speaker, as should the last two lines in the poem,
lines 251-252, p. 13. Page ten mistakenly carries the number twelve at
the top of the page.

The first Publication of the following Poem having
been entrusted to the Care of the Printer, it came,
thro' either his Ignorance or Timorousness,
extremely mutilated, and incorrect from the Press.
The twenty last Lines were left out, which made the
Conclusion very abrupt, and in a great measure
destroy'd the Intention, as well as Unity, of the
whole Piece. The Characters of some great
Personages were entirely omitted, and fictitious
Names placed to others, instead of the real ones
inserted by the Author, who was always of Opinion,
that deserved Praise, as well as just Satire,
should disdain a Mask. As to the Pointing, it was
false in almost every Line, and there were many
Words either mis-plac'd or mis-spell'd in almost
every Page. Notwithstanding its appearing under
these many Disadvantages, the Public were pleas'd
to shew their Approbation of it in general, and to
give it such a generous and uncommon Reception,
that a large Number were obliged to be printed off,
to supply the present Demand, before there was
Leisure to restore or correct any thing. The
following Edition was at length undertaken by the
Author Himself, and is entirely agreeable to the
Manuscript which he at first put into the Hands
of the Printer.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
